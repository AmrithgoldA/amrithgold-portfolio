            <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>I embarked on my journey to become a software developer alone, without any teacher or mentor. At that time, I had some prior knowledge of programming. I seized the opportunity to learn something new during the lockdown, and it turned out to be an incredible journey. I have learned extensively from online resources, without taking any formal courses. Now, I specialize in React and Node and am capable of creating software independently.</p>
